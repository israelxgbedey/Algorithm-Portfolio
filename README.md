## ðŸ“ˆ Big O Notation Analysis (Assignment 1)


### Big O Complexity Explanations
- **Constant Time Complexity**: `O(1)` â€“ Operations that take the same time regardless of input size.
- **Linear Time Complexity**: `O(n)` â€“ Operations where the time grows linearly with input size.
- **Quadratic Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` â€“ Operations that grow quadratically with input size, often involving nested iterations.

### Code Comments
Each function includes comments explaining:
- The time complexity.
- Why each function fits into a specific Big O category.
